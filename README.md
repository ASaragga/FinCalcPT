*Financial calculus is not typically a core requirement for solicitors, as their primary focus is on legal matters such as drafting contracts, providing legal advice, and representing clients in court. However, certain areas of legal practice do require a good understanding of financial concepts, models and calculus and can give solicitors an edge, particularly in those areas involving financial transactions, contracts, and disputes.*

# Topics at the Intersection of Law & Finance 

**Areas where Financial Skills may be Useful for Solicitors**

  - Interest calculations: Financial calculus helps with understanding interest rates, loan amortization schedules, and the time value of money.

  - Capital gains and losses: Understanding the timing and calculation of capital gains or losses over time, including any taxation on deferred gains.
- Property Law
  - Mortgages and loan agreements: A basic understanding of financial calculus, particularly compound interest, is useful in drafting and negotiating loan agreements and mortgages.

Bayer agrees to pay more than $10 billion to settle claims that its weedkiller, Roundup, caused cancer. Why not $15 billion or $5 billion?

Lawyers negotiate deals and manage lawsuits involving billions of dollars each year. To do that, you need more than legal expertise. You need a fundamental understanding of the finances behind a deal or dispute, including how to read and analyze financial statements or use financial concepts to value a business, patent, or marital estate. You need more than law knowledge to advise a client on any significant transaction — and to help a client even assess whether it's best to pursue a claim or to settle.

Successful attorneys cannot leave accounting, finance and valuation solely to a finance team, or outside experts. You need to independently understand the financial opportunities your client faces and discuss them using the language of finance. Through examples of disputes, valuations, and presentations from real-world practitioners, this course will teach you how to interpret and use financial data, make a business case for a deal or lawsuit, and understand when and how experts can support — or undermine — your work. 

**Key practice exercises**
- Using present value to analyze a legal doctrine
- Choosing among payment options for settlement of a lawsuit
- Estimating profit and compensation from the BP Oil Spill Fund for a company harmed by the spill
- Valuing the hedge fund partnership interest of a husband involved in a divorce
- Calculating harm from a breach of contract
- Calculating the benefit from the misappropriation of intellectual property
- Deriving the fair value of a company using Comparable Company Analysis and DCF models

**Takeaways**
- Accounting, finance, and valuation are key elements in many legal disputes
- Present value, discounting, the perpetuity formula, Comparable Company Analysis and the DCF model are all used by lawyers in various ways in real lawsuits
